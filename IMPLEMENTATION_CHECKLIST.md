# Implementation Plan Checklist (REPLANNED)

## Original Question/Task

**Question:** <h1>College Event Management System</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You are tasked with developing a College Event Management System that allows administrators to create events and students to register for and track their participation in these events. The system will have both a backend API built with Spring Boot and a frontend interface built with React.</p>

<h2>Question Requirements</h2>

<h3>Backend Requirements (Spring Boot)</h3>

<h4>1. Event Management</h4>
<p>Create a RESTful API to manage events with the following endpoints:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Create Event (POST /api/events)</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Administrators should be able to create new events</li>
            <li>Required fields: eventName, description, date, time, venue, capacity, category</li>
            <li>Response should include the created event with a unique eventId</li>
            <li>Status code: 201 Created on success</li>
            <li>Status code: 400 Bad Request if validation fails with appropriate error message</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example request body:</p>
        <code>
        {
            "eventName": "Tech Symposium 2023",
            "description": "Annual technology showcase featuring student projects",
            "date": "2023-11-15",
            "time": "10:00 AM",
            "venue": "Main Auditorium",
            "capacity": 200,
            "category": "TECHNICAL"
        }
        </code>
    </li>
    <li><b>Get All Events (GET /api/events)</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Return a list of all events</li>
            <li>Status code: 200 OK</li>
            <li>Response should include pagination with page and size parameters</li>
            <li>Default page size: 10 events</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Get Event by ID (GET /api/events/{eventId})</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Return details of a specific event</li>
            <li>Status code: 200 OK if found</li>
            <li>Status code: 404 Not Found if event doesn't exist with message "Event not found"</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Student Registration</h4>
<p>Implement registration functionality with the following endpoints:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Register for Event (POST /api/registrations)</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow students to register for events</li>
            <li>Required fields: studentId, eventId</li>
            <li>Status code: 201 Created on successful registration</li>
            <li>Status code: 400 Bad Request if the event is at capacity with message "Event is at full capacity"</li>
            <li>Status code: 409 Conflict if student is already registered with message "Student already registered for this event"</li>
            <li>Status code: 404 Not Found if event or student doesn't exist</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example request body:</p>
        <code>
        {
            "studentId": "S12345",
            "eventId": 1
        }
        </code>
    </li>
    <li><b>Get Student Registrations (GET /api/registrations/students/{studentId})</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Return all events a student has registered for</li>
            <li>Status code: 200 OK</li>
            <li>Status code: 404 Not Found if student doesn't exist</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Data Models</h4>
<p>Implement the following entity classes with appropriate relationships:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Event</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Fields: eventId (Long, auto-generated), eventName (String, not null), description (String), date (LocalDate, not null), time (String, not null), venue (String, not null), capacity (Integer, positive), category (Enum: TECHNICAL, CULTURAL, SPORTS, WORKSHOP), registrations (One-to-Many relationship with Registration)</li>
            <li>Validation: eventName must be between 5-100 characters</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Student</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Fields: studentId (String, primary key), name (String, not null), email (String, unique, not null), department (String), registrations (One-to-Many relationship with Registration)</li>
            <li>Validation: email must be a valid email format</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Registration</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Fields: registrationId (Long, auto-generated), student (Many-to-One relationship with Student), event (Many-to-One relationship with Event), registrationDate (LocalDateTime, auto-set to current time), attended (Boolean, default false)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Use MySQL as the backend database.</p>

<h3>Frontend Requirements (React)</h3>

<h4>1. Event Listing Page</h4>
<p>Create a component to display all events with the following features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Display events in a card layout showing eventName, date, venue, and category</li>
    <li>Implement filtering by category (dropdown with options: ALL, TECHNICAL, CULTURAL, SPORTS, WORKSHOP)</li>
    <li>Each event card should have a "View Details" button</li>
    <li>Show a loading indicator while fetching events</li>
    <li>Display an error message if events cannot be loaded</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Event Details Component</h4>
<p>Create a component to display detailed information about a selected event:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Show all event details (name, description, date, time, venue, capacity)</li>
    <li>Display the number of registrations and available spots</li>
    <li>Include a "Register" button that is disabled if the event is at capacity</li>
    <li>Show a success message after successful registration</li>
    <li>Display appropriate error messages for registration failures</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Student Dashboard</h4>
<p>Create a component for students to view their registered events:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Display a list of events the student has registered for</li>
    <li>Include event details (name, date, venue) for each registration</li>
    <li>Implement a simple form at the top to enter studentId and load registrations</li>
    <li>Show a "No registrations found" message when appropriate</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Navigation and Routing</h4>
<p>Implement React Router with the following routes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>/</code> - Home page with event listing</li>
    <li><code>/events/:eventId</code> - Event details page</li>
    <li><code>/dashboard</code> - Student dashboard</li>
    <li>Include a navigation bar with links to these routes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Integration Requirements</h3>
<p>Ensure proper integration between frontend and backend:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use Axios or Fetch API to make HTTP requests from React to Spring Boot endpoints</li>
    <li>Implement proper error handling for API requests</li>
    <li>Ensure all form submissions include appropriate validation</li>
    <li>Use React state management to maintain application state</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Requirements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Implement proper input validation on both frontend and backend</li>
    <li>Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) for component state management</li>
    <li>Ensure the application is responsive and user-friendly</li>
    <li>Follow best practices for code organization and component structure</li>
</ul>

**Created:** 2025-07-28 06:09:03 (Replan #2)
**Total Steps:** 2
**Previous Execution:** 1 steps completed before replanning

## Replanning Context
- **Replanning Attempt:** #2
- **Trigger:** V2 execution error encountered

## Previously Completed Steps

✅ Step 1: FIX: Address backend JUnit test failures related to status codes, JSON values, and Jackson LocalDate serialization in test cases.

## NEW Implementation Plan Checklist

### Step 1: FIX: Resolve Jest SyntaxError due to ESM version of axios by downgrading axios to compatible CommonJS version.
- [x] **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Files to modify:**
  - /home/coder/project/workspace/question_generation_service/solutions/41dfe1e9-c64a-4e25-9498-4b755fe04a54/reactapp/package.json
- **Description:** Downgrades axios to a Jest-compatible (CommonJS) version to resolve SyntaxError, allowing React Jest tests to import axios with create-react-app/rjs Jest setup.

### Step 2: Compile, build, lint, and test the React frontend.
- [ ] **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Description:** Verifies frontend app builds, lints cleanly, and passes all Jest tests as required.

## NEW Plan Completion Status

| Step | Status | Completion Time |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Step 1 | ✅ Completed | 2025-07-28 06:09:32 |
| Step 2 | ❌ Failed | 2025-07-28 06:10:41 |

## Notes & Issues

### Replanning History
- Replan #2: V2 execution error encountered

### Errors Encountered
- Step 2: Step 2 failed due to a test failure in App.test.js: Could not find a label with the text /Student ID/. The StudentDashboard component's label was updated (removed the colon), but the test is still failing. Further debugging required to fully match the label for the test.

### Important Decisions
- Step 1: Axios was downgraded to 0.27.2, npm install was run, and Jest cache was cleaned as required.

### Next Actions
- Resume implementation following the NEW checklist
- Use `update_plan_checklist_tool` to mark steps as completed
- Use `read_plan_checklist_tool` to check current status
